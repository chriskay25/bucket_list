# Bucket List Sinatra App

This Sinatra-based web app allows users to keep track of places on their bucket list they would like to visit. 

## Installation

Clone or fork the repository from https://github.com/chriskay25/bucket_list.

Change directory in your terminal:
    
    $ cd bucket_list

Make sure bundler is installed and then run:

    $ bundle install

Then run:

    $ shotgun

And finally, in a browser go to http://localhost:9393 to get started and make an account.

## Usage

Once users have signed up for an account, they can log in and will be taken to their profile page. From this page they can see how many destinations are in their bucket list, start adding items to it if it's empty OR click the link to view destinations previously added, and edit or delete their profile.

When users click the 'View' link from their profile page they will be shown all of destinations in their bucket list, with options to add, edit, or delete locations.
