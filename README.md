# Bucket List Sinatra App

This Sinatra-based web app allows users to create bucket lists and keep track of destinations they would like to visit and experiences they'd like to have before they die. 

## Installation

Clone or fork the repository from https://github.com/chriskay25/bucket_list.

Change directory in your terminal:
    
    $ cd bucket_list

Make sure bundler is installed and then run:

    $ bundle install

Then run:

    $ shotgun

And finally, in a browser go to http://localhost:9393 to get started and make an account.

## Usage

Once users have signed up for an account, they can log in and will be taken to their profile page. From this page they can see how many items are in their bucket list, add items to it, or view lists of their destinations/experiences previously added. Users can also edit or delete their profile.
